# Random Anime Generator Privacy Policy
This is an open source Android app developed by Emir Gencer, the code is avaliable in this repo and is licenced under MIT license.

This app is not programmed to collect any personally identifiable information. For saving and blacklisting features to work, the app stores these information locally, and that information can be deleted by clearing the app's data.

The app sends GET requests to https://myanimelist.net/ to pick animes and get information about them. This is done to get the anime's title, MAL score, description, details, and image. Hence, some information such as the user's IP address is sent to that address.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please open an issue on this github repository.
